# group-meditation
A group meditation app that all people can do together, similar to a live stream, but each person and group can meditate on certain topics to help gather intent.

I know that prayer circles at churches are focused in this way, and this could be a way to help people all pray together around the world. Intent seems to be a common way for people from differing religions to unite together to sent positive feelings and ideas toward things. This could be a way to connect all of those people.

The source code of this application will be open and viewable to the public so that it can be monitored at any time so that it would be a source for goodness. However, each piece of software that is new starts off beautiful like a newborn child, and then somehow it grows into a grotesque Frankenstein-style monster at the end, full of abominations of code, hooked up to life support with blank death in its eyes, so we'll see how this project goes.
